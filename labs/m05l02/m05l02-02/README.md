# m05l02-02 · Start the broker and create the orders topic

**Lesson:** [The Schema Registry](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m05l02) (lesson 5.2, module 5: Schemas, Serialisation And Evolution) · Pro  
**Check:** Read along

## Goal

You can register a JSON schema with a schema registry, list subjects, retrieve a schema by version, and explain the TopicNameStrategy naming convention and the Confluent wire format magic byte.

In the lesson: The setup starts a broker on a dedicated network for this lesson. The schema registry is included in the Redpanda dev-container image with no extra configuration: once the broker is running, the registry API is available at port eight-thousand and eighty-one on the broker container. We also create the orders topic so that later in the lesson we can refer to subject naming conventions with a real topic name. The topic uses a single partition because the lesson focuses on schema operations, not on distribution. The topic is ready when the status line prints the confirmation.

## Files

- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/setup.sh`](starter/setup.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Read `starter/setup.sh` alongside the lesson.
2. On a machine that has what it needs, the lesson ran it with:

   ```sh
   bash setup.sh
   ```

## How to check

**Read along.** It needs Docker (or another container engine), which the lab sandbox does not have. Run it on a machine with Docker installed.

There is nothing to check: `./check m05l02-02` says so and moves on.
