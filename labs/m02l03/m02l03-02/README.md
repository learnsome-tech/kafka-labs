# m02l03-02 · Start the broker and create the topic

**Lesson:** [Acknowledgements: What Acks Means For Durability](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m02l03) (lesson 2.3, module 2: Producers: Keys, Batches And Acks) · Pro  
**Check:** Read along

## Goal

You can set acks on a KafkaProducer to zero, one, or all, explain what each level waits for, and describe what min-insync-replicas does when a write requires confirmation from more replicas than are currently available.

In the lesson: The topic for this lesson is named reliable because the lesson is about durability guarantees. The broker starts with one replica per partition, which is the default for a single-node cluster. A single replica means the leader and the sole in-sync replica are the same broker. Later in the lesson you will set min-insync-replicas to two and see what the error looks like when that requirement cannot be met, because the demonstration requires showing you what the error message says rather than pretending the configuration is always satisfiable.

## Files

- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/start.sh`](starter/start.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Read `starter/start.sh` alongside the lesson.
2. On a machine that has what it needs, the lesson ran it with:

   ```sh
   bash start.sh
   ```

## How to check

**Read along.** It needs Docker (or another container engine), which the lab sandbox does not have. Run it on a machine with Docker installed.

There is nothing to check: `./check m02l03-02` says so and moves on.
