# m04l03-02 · Broker and two topics ready for transaction demo

**Lesson:** [Transactions And Exactly Once Semantics](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m04l03) (lesson 4.3, module 4: Delivery Guarantees And Transactions) · Pro  
**Check:** Checker

## Goal

You can write a transactional Kafka producer that commits and aborts, explain what read-committed isolation means for a consumer, and describe why a read-committed consumer sees zero records from an aborted transaction.

In the lesson: The setup creates two topics: one for the committed transaction and one for the aborted transaction. Keeping them separate makes the contrast between the two outcomes clearer throughout the lesson. Both topics use a single partition so that ordering is deterministic. When both topics are confirmed, the broker is ready to accept transactional producers and the client image is already built. The names follow the lesson-encoding convention so they cannot clash with other lessons on the same machine.

## Files

- [`starter/Dockerfile`](starter/Dockerfile)
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/setup.sh`](starter/setup.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m04l03/m04l03-02/starter`
2. Read `setup.sh`.
3. Edit `setup.sh` and check it: `bash -n setup.sh`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m04l03-02`.

## How to check

`./check m04l03-02` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `bash -n setup.sh` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

**Read along, with a syntax check.** Running it needs Docker and the Kafka broker containers the course starts, which the lab sandbox does not have, so the site shows it with its recorded output.

This is a checker lab: it checks that the shell script parses (`bash -n`), without running it. The site shows the checker's report without grading; `./check` passes when the checker finds no errors.
