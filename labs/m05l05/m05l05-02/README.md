# m05l05-02 · Start the broker, build the client, create the topic

**Lesson:** [Headers, Envelopes And Event Metadata](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m05l05) (lesson 5.5, module 5: Schemas, Serialisation And Evolution) · Pro  
**Check:** Read along

## Goal

You can attach record headers to a Kafka message in kafka-python, design an envelope structure with event ID, type, version, occurred-at, and payload, and consume both headers and envelope fields in a deterministic printed output.

In the lesson: The setup creates the network, starts the broker, builds the client image, and creates the events topic. The lesson uses a single-partition topic so that the one record we produce is always at offset zero and the consumer output is deterministic. All resource names carry the m-zero-five-l-zero-five prefix so they remain isolated from other lessons on the same machine.

## Files

- [`starter/Dockerfile`](starter/Dockerfile)
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/setup.sh`](starter/setup.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Read `starter/setup.sh` alongside the lesson.
2. On a machine that has what it needs, the lesson ran it with:

   ```sh
   bash setup.sh
   ```

## How to check

**Read along.** It needs Docker (or another container engine), which the lab sandbox does not have. Run it on a machine with Docker installed.

There is nothing to check: `./check m05l05-02` says so and moves on.
