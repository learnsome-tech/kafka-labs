# m05l05-02 · Start the broker, build the client, create the topic

**Lesson:** [Headers, Envelopes And Event Metadata](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m05l05) (lesson 5.5, module 5: Schemas, Serialisation And Evolution) · Pro  
**Check:** Checker

## Goal

You can attach record headers to a Kafka message in kafka-python, design an envelope structure with event ID, type, version, occurred-at, and payload, and consume both headers and envelope fields in a deterministic printed output.

In the lesson: The setup creates the network, starts the broker, builds the client image, and creates the events topic. The lesson uses a single-partition topic so that the one record we produce is always at offset zero and the consumer output is deterministic. All resource names carry the m-zero-five-l-zero-five prefix so they remain isolated from other lessons on the same machine.

## Files

- [`starter/Dockerfile`](starter/Dockerfile)
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/setup.sh`](starter/setup.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m05l05/m05l05-02/starter`
2. Read `setup.sh`.
3. Edit `setup.sh` and check it: `bash -n setup.sh`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m05l05-02`.

## How to check

`./check m05l05-02` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `bash -n setup.sh` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

**Read along, with a syntax check.** Running it needs Docker and the Kafka broker containers the course starts, which the lab sandbox does not have, so the site shows it with its recorded output.

This is a checker lab: it checks that the shell script parses (`bash -n`), without running it. The site shows the checker's report without grading; `./check` passes when the checker finds no errors.
