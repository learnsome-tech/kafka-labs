# m06l02-02 · Start broker, database and build the outbox client

**Lesson:** [The Transactional Outbox](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m06l02) (lesson 6.2, module 6: Event-Driven: Outbox, CDC, Compaction) · Pro  
**Check:** Read along

## Goal

You can implement a transactional outbox that writes a business row and an event record in a single database transaction, build a relay that publishes unpublished rows to Kafka and marks them published, and confirm that a second relay run produces no duplicates.

In the lesson: The setup creates two tables and the topic in the same Postgres instance. The orders table holds business rows and the outbox table holds event records waiting to be relayed. Both tables appear in the output when two tables and the topic are confirmed by the setup script. The broker and client image are ready alongside them, and all four resources share the lesson network.

## Files

- [`starter/Dockerfile`](starter/Dockerfile)
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/setup.sh`](starter/setup.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Read `starter/setup.sh` alongside the lesson.
2. On a machine that has what it needs, the lesson ran it with:

   ```sh
   bash setup.sh
   ```

## How to check

**Read along.** It needs Docker (or another container engine), which the lab sandbox does not have. Run it on a machine with Docker installed.

There is nothing to check: `./check m06l02-02` says so and moves on.
