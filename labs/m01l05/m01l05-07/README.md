# m01l05-07 · Remove the broker and network

**Lesson:** [Retention: Time, Size And Why Data Stays](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m01l05) (lesson 1.5, module 1: The Log: Topics, Partitions And Offsets) · Free  
**Check:** Read along

## Goal

You can set time-based and size-based retention on a topic with rpk topic alter-config, verify the settings with rpk topic describe -c, and explain why retention deletes at segment boundaries rather than individual records.

In the lesson: We clean up the broker and network to finish the lesson. The force flag on docker rm covers cases where the broker is still running background threads for log cleaning or compaction. The Docker network is removed after the container, since active endpoints prevent network removal. The two echoed names confirm both resources are gone. The next module moves from the log structure to the producers that write to it and the delivery guarantees they can provide.

## Files

- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/session.sh`](starter/session.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/setup.sh`](starter/setup.sh)
- [`starter/start.sh`](starter/start.sh)
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Read `starter/session.sh` alongside the lesson.
2. On a machine that has what it needs, the lesson ran it with:

   ```sh
   bash setup.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
   docker rm -f m01l05-broker
   docker network rm m01l05-net
   ```

## How to check

**Read along.** It needs Docker (or another container engine), which the lab sandbox does not have. Run it on a machine with Docker installed.

There is nothing to check: `./check m01l05-07` says so and moves on.
