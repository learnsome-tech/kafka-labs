# m01l05-02 · Start a network and broker

**Lesson:** [Retention: Time, Size And Why Data Stays](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m01l05) (lesson 1.5, module 1: The Log: Topics, Partitions And Offsets) · Free  
**Check:** Read along

## Goal

You can set time-based and size-based retention on a topic with rpk topic alter-config, verify the settings with rpk topic describe -c, and explain why retention deletes at segment boundaries rather than individual records.

In the lesson: We follow the same broker startup recipe used throughout this module. A new Docker network and a new Redpanda container, both named after this lesson to isolate them from anything else on the shared machine. Dev container mode, one processor core, half a gigabyte of memory, and the kafka address advertised as the container name on the network. The script completes once both resources exist. The two output lines in the panel below confirm the network identifier and the container identifier. The retention configuration commands later in this lesson use rpk topic alter-config, which applies changes to a live topic without requiring a broker restart.

## Files

- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/start.sh`](starter/start.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Read `starter/start.sh` alongside the lesson.
2. On a machine that has what it needs, the lesson ran it with:

   ```sh
   bash start.sh
   ```

## How to check

**Read along.** It needs Docker (or another container engine), which the lab sandbox does not have. Run it on a machine with Docker installed.

There is nothing to check: `./check m01l05-02` says so and moves on.
