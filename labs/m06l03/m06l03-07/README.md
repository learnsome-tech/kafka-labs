# m06l03-07 · Remove the database and network

**Lesson:** [Change Data Capture In Principle](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m06l03) (lesson 6.3, module 6: Event-Driven: Outbox, CDC, Compaction) · Pro  
**Check:** Read along

## Goal

You can start a Postgres instance with logical replication enabled, create a replication slot using the test decoding plugin, and read the change stream produced by insert and update statements to explain how a connector such as Debezium turns those changes into Kafka events.

In the lesson: We stop the database container and remove the network. This lesson does not use a Kafka broker because the focus is on the database side of change data capture: the write-ahead log, the replication slot, and the change stream format. The broker would be introduced by a connector in a real deployment, sitting between the slot and the consumer topics.

## Files

- [`starter/cdc.sh`](starter/cdc.sh)
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/session.sh`](starter/session.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/setup.sh`](starter/setup.sh)
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Read `starter/session.sh` alongside the lesson.
2. On a machine that has what it needs, the lesson ran it with:

   ```sh
   bash setup.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
   docker rm -f m06l03-db
   docker network rm m06l03-net
   ```

## How to check

**Read along.** It needs Docker (or another container engine), which the lab sandbox does not have. Run it on a machine with Docker installed.

There is nothing to check: `./check m06l03-07` says so and moves on.
