# m06l03-03 · Insert a product row and then update it

**Lesson:** [Change Data Capture In Principle](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m06l03) (lesson 6.3, module 6: Event-Driven: Outbox, CDC, Compaction) · Pro  
**Check:** Read along

## Goal

You can start a Postgres instance with logical replication enabled, create a replication slot using the test decoding plugin, and read the change stream produced by insert and update statements to explain how a connector such as Debezium turns those changes into Kafka events.

In the lesson: We insert one product and then update it. Both statements are plain data manipulation: there is nothing special about them from the application side. The database records both changes in the write-ahead log automatically because the slot is active and the log level is logical. One row is inserted and one row is updated, giving us two events to read from the change stream.

## Files

- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/session.sh`](starter/session.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/setup.sh`](starter/setup.sh)
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Read `starter/session.sh` alongside the lesson.
2. On a machine that has what it needs, the lesson ran it with:

   ```sh
   bash setup.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
   E="docker exec m06l03-db psql -U postgres -c"
   $E "INSERT INTO products (item) VALUES ('widget')"
   $E "UPDATE products SET item = 'gadget' WHERE id = 1"
   ```

## How to check

**Read along.** The listing does not run cleanly in the lab sandbox (it relies on something the sandbox cannot provide), so the site shows it read-only.

There is nothing to check: `./check m06l03-03` says so and moves on.
