# m03l03-02 · Start the broker and network

**Lesson:** [Committing Offsets: Auto, Manual And Lag](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m03l03) (lesson 3.3, module 3: Consumers And Consumer Groups) · Pro  
**Check:** Read along

## Goal

You can configure a KafkaConsumer to commit offsets manually, observe the lag a consumer group carries before committing, and confirm that a second run resumes from the committed position.

In the lesson: The broker and its network start in the same pattern as the previous lessons. The broker name and network name both carry the lesson identifier to prevent collisions with anything else running on the same machine. Two records that are produced to this broker before any consumer reads them appear as lag in every group that subscribes to the topic.

## Files

- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/setup.sh`](starter/setup.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Read `starter/setup.sh` alongside the lesson.
2. On a machine that has what it needs, the lesson ran it with:

   ```sh
   bash setup.sh
   ```

## How to check

**Read along.** It needs Docker (or another container engine), which the lab sandbox does not have. Run it on a machine with Docker installed.

There is nothing to check: `./check m03l03-02` says so and moves on.
