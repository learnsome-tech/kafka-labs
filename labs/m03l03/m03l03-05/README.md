# m03l03-05 · Read without committing, observe the gap

**Lesson:** [Committing Offsets: Auto, Manual And Lag](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m03l03) (lesson 3.3, module 3: Consumers And Consumer Groups) · Pro  
**Check:** Checker

## Goal

You can configure a KafkaConsumer to commit offsets manually, observe the lag a consumer group carries before committing, and confirm that a second run resumes from the committed position.

In the lesson: Without the commit flag, the consumer reads all four records from the beginning of partition zero, prints each one, and then exits with the message that no commit was made. The four records land at offsets zero through three exactly as produced. The consumer-timeout fires after three seconds of silence and the loop ends. But because enable-auto-commit is false and we never called commit, the auditors group still has no committed offset on the broker. If you ran rpk group describe right now, you would see the group without a committed offset for partition zero: the broker recorded that the group joined and read, but nothing further.

## Files

- [`starter/Dockerfile`](starter/Dockerfile)
- [`starter/consumer.py`](starter/consumer.py): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/setup.sh`](starter/setup.sh)
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m03l03/m03l03-05/starter`
2. Read `consumer.py`.
3. Edit `consumer.py` and check it: `python3 -m py_compile consumer.py`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m03l03-05`.

## How to check

`./check m03l03-05` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `python3 -m py_compile consumer.py` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

**Read along, with a syntax check.** Running it needs Docker and the Kafka broker containers the course starts, which the lab sandbox does not have, so the site shows it with its recorded output.

This is a checker lab: it checks that the Python program compiles (`python3 -m py_compile`), without running it. The site shows the checker's report without grading; `./check` passes when the checker finds no errors.
