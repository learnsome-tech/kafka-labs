# m01l04-02 · Start a network and broker

**Lesson:** [Offsets: Position, Not Acknowledgement](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m01l04) (lesson 1.4, module 1: The Log: Topics, Partitions And Offsets) · Free  
**Check:** Read along

## Goal

You can consume a topic from a specific offset, demonstrate that two independent consumers see the same records at the same offsets, and explain why the offset belongs to the record and not to the reader.

In the lesson: We start a fresh broker on its own network, named after this lesson as always. The broker recipe is unchanged from the previous lessons: dev container mode, single core, half a gigabyte of memory, and the kafka address advertised as the container name on the Docker network. Every lesson in this module follows the same startup pattern so that the broker configuration is never the variable. The network identifier and container identifier both print to the panel when the script finishes, and the broker will be ready after the short sleep at the start of the next segment.

## Files

- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/start.sh`](starter/start.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Read `starter/start.sh` alongside the lesson.
2. On a machine that has what it needs, the lesson ran it with:

   ```sh
   bash start.sh
   ```

## How to check

**Read along.** It needs Docker (or another container engine), which the lab sandbox does not have. Run it on a machine with Docker installed.

There is nothing to check: `./check m01l04-02` says so and moves on.
