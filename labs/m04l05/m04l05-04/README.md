# m04l05-04 · Produce one record to start the pipeline

**Lesson:** [Retries With Backoff Topics](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m04l05) (lesson 4.5, module 4: Delivery Guarantees And Transactions) · Pro  
**Check:** Read along

## Goal

You can implement a retry-topic pattern that routes a failing record through numbered tiers before landing it in a dead letter queue, and explain how an attempt counter in the value makes routing deterministic.

In the lesson: The producer sends a single payment record with an amount and an initial attempt counter of zero. The zero signals that this record has never been retried: the router that reads it will increment the counter to one before forwarding it to the first retry tier. Using zero as the starting value keeps the counter equal to the number of retries the record has already been through, which is a clean invariant for the routing logic to check when deciding whether to advance or stop.

## Files

- [`starter/Dockerfile`](starter/Dockerfile)
- [`starter/producer.py`](starter/producer.py): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/setup.sh`](starter/setup.sh)
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Read `starter/producer.py` alongside the lesson.
2. On a machine that has what it needs, the lesson ran it with:

   ```sh
   bash setup.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
   docker run --rm --network m04l05-net -v "$PWD:/app" m04l05-client python producer.py
   ```

## How to check

**Read along.** It needs Docker (or another container engine), which the lab sandbox does not have. Run it on a machine with Docker installed.

There is nothing to check: `./check m04l05-04` says so and moves on.
