# m03l01-05 · Run the consumer and read the records back

**Lesson:** [A Consumer In Python](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m03l01) (lesson 3.1, module 3: Consumers And Consumer Groups) · Pro  
**Check:** Checker

## Goal

You can write a KafkaConsumer in Python that reads from the beginning of a topic, prints partition, offset, key and value for every record, and exits automatically when the topic goes quiet.

In the lesson: The container mounts the working directory into slash app so the Python file written in the previous step is available at runtime. The consumer joins the group named m-zero-three-l-zero-one-readers, receives partition zero as its sole assignment, and begins reading from offset zero because the group has never committed. Each of the three records comes back with the exact key and value we produced. The first record is partition zero, offset zero, key u-one, value login. The second is offset one, key u-two, value signup. The third is offset two, key u-one again, value logout. Three seconds then pass with no new records, the consumer-timeout fires, and the script closes the connection and exits. The output is deterministic because a single-partition topic preserves the exact order records were produced, and the group has never moved its offset.

## Files

- [`starter/Dockerfile`](starter/Dockerfile)
- [`starter/consumer.py`](starter/consumer.py): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/setup.sh`](starter/setup.sh)
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m03l01/m03l01-05/starter`
2. Read `consumer.py`.
3. Edit `consumer.py` and check it: `python3 -m py_compile consumer.py`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m03l01-05`.

## How to check

`./check m03l01-05` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `python3 -m py_compile consumer.py` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

**Read along, with a syntax check.** Running it needs Docker and the Kafka broker containers the course starts, which the lab sandbox does not have, so the site shows it with its recorded output.

This is a checker lab: it checks that the Python program compiles (`python3 -m py_compile`), without running it. The site shows the checker's report without grading; `./check` passes when the checker finds no errors.
