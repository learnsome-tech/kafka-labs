# m03l04-02 · Start the broker and network

**Lesson:** [Rebalancing And Its Cost](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m03l04) (lesson 3.4, module 3: Consumers And Consumer Groups) · Pro  
**Check:** Checker

## Goal

You can explain what triggers a rebalance, configure session and heartbeat timeouts, and describe what happens to a consumer that exceeds max-poll-interval-milliseconds.

In the lesson: The broker and network start in the same pattern as every other lesson in this module. The lesson name is embedded in every resource name so the verifier can track and clean up exactly what this lesson creates.

## Files

- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/setup.sh`](starter/setup.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m03l04/m03l04-02/starter`
2. Read `setup.sh`.
3. Edit `setup.sh` and check it: `bash -n setup.sh`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m03l04-02`.

## How to check

`./check m03l04-02` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `bash -n setup.sh` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

**Read along, with a syntax check.** Running it needs Docker and the Kafka broker containers the course starts, which the lab sandbox does not have, so the site shows it with its recorded output.

This is a checker lab: it checks that the shell script parses (`bash -n`), without running it. The site shows the checker's report without grading; `./check` passes when the checker finds no errors.
