# m06l05-02 · Start the broker and create the orders topic

**Lesson:** [Materialised Views From A Stream](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m06l05) (lesson 6.5, module 6: Event-Driven: Outbox, CDC, Compaction) · Pro  
**Check:** Read along

## Goal

You can produce a stream of order events, write a consumer that folds the stream into per-customer totals and prints a sorted table, and rebuild the same view from offset zero using a fresh consumer group to demonstrate that the stream is the source of truth.

In the lesson: A single-partition topic gives ordered delivery across all customers, which keeps the fold results deterministic. When the orders topic is ready, producers can write to it and the fold result will always be the same for the same sequence of events. With multiple partitions and keyed records, each customer would stay ordered within their assigned partition, giving the same guarantee per key.

## Files

- [`starter/Dockerfile`](starter/Dockerfile)
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/setup.sh`](starter/setup.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Read `starter/setup.sh` alongside the lesson.
2. On a machine that has what it needs, the lesson ran it with:

   ```sh
   bash setup.sh
   ```

## How to check

**Read along.** It needs Docker (or another container engine), which the lab sandbox does not have. Run it on a machine with Docker installed.

There is nothing to check: `./check m06l05-02` says so and moves on.
