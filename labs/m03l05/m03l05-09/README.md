# m03l05-09 · Remove the broker and network

**Lesson:** [At Most Once, At Least Once](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m03l05) (lesson 3.5, module 3: Consumers And Consumer Groups) · Pro  
**Check:** Read along

## Goal

You can implement at-least-once and at-most-once consumers, simulate a crash mid-batch, and explain which records are reprocessed or lost in each scenario.

In the lesson: We stop the broker and remove the network. The broker exits cleanly and the network disappears. Both consumer groups, the pipeline group and the at-most-once group, existed only on this broker and are gone with it.

## Files

- [`starter/Dockerfile`](starter/Dockerfile)
- [`starter/alo.py`](starter/alo.py)
- [`starter/amo.py`](starter/amo.py)
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/session.sh`](starter/session.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/setup.sh`](starter/setup.sh)
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Read `starter/session.sh` alongside the lesson.
2. On a machine that has what it needs, the lesson ran it with:

   ```sh
   bash setup.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
   docker rm -f m03l05-broker
   docker network rm m03l05-net
   ```

## How to check

**Read along.** It needs Docker (or another container engine), which the lab sandbox does not have. Run it on a machine with Docker installed.

There is nothing to check: `./check m03l05-09` says so and moves on.
